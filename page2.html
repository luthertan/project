 <img src="AI.jpg" class="responsive-img"/>
 <h4> Technology </h4>                                                  
<li>With the ever changing technology also increase the need for the management of data which i feel that will be crucial in the future thus i made the choice of changing my field of study </li> 
 <h4> Job Prospect</h4>  
 <li> At such a fast paced world, some jobs will be phased out without any warning where the jobs will be taken over by Artificial Intelligence (AI) or technologies. I, too, felt afraid that my previous course of study (Civil Engineering) would be phased out too. </li>
